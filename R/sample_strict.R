#' @title Assign Rows and Sample 
#' @description Assign rows to columns of a matrix with scrabble::maxcol_strict and subsequently sample from each column's group.
#' @param mat a matrix
#' @param size sample size
#' @param min minimum value required for a row to be assigned to a column. Default: 1
#' @param diff minimum difference in value to the 'next-best' row that is required for a row to be assigned to a column. Default: 0.5
#' @param replace boolean value indicating whether sample replacement is allowed. Will be set to TRUE with warning if the sample is smaller than the sample size. Default: F
#' @return a list of sampled rows for each column, each elemnent a character vector of size <size>
#' @rdname sample_strict
#' @export

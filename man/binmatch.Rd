\title{Control Signatures From Expression Bins}
\usage{
binmatch(Group, mat = NULL, x = NULL, bins = NULL, nbin = 30,
  n = 100, replace = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Group}{a character vector.}

\item{mat}{a matrix.}

\item{x}{a named numeric vector to generate bins from. If NULL, x will be computed from mat. Default: NULL}

\item{bins}{a named character vector with as names the rownames and as values the ID of each bin. Default: NULL}

\item{nbin}{numeric value. How many bins should be created? Default: 30}

\item{n}{numeric value for the number of control values to return per value in Group. Default: 100}

\item{replace}{boolean value. Allow bin sampling to be done with replacement. Default: F}
}
\value{
a character vector of length n * length(Group), containing the binmatched values for the values (gene names) in Group.
}
\description{
Return a control signature for the signature or <Group> provided. Control signatures are generated by binning the average row values (average gene expression values) and sampling from the resulting bins such that every value in the original signature has <n> bin-matched values in the resulting output.
